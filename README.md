🚀 Showcasing My Latest Project: Walmart Sales Data Analysis 🛒

I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I dived deep into Walmart's sales data to uncover valuable insights using SQL and Power BI. 💻📊

Here's what I accomplished:

🔍 Data Analysis with SQL: I created a comprehensive database to explore various aspects of Walmart's sales, including customer demographics, product performance, and revenue generation. Through SQL, I answered key business questions such as:

Which cities and branches generate the most revenue?
What customer types bring in the highest revenue and pay the most VAT?
How do different product lines perform in terms of revenue and customer preference?
📊 Visualizing Insights with Power BI: To make the data actionable, I transformed the SQL queries into visually compelling reports. Some of the key visualizations include:

Revenue by City and Branch
Customer Demographics and Preferences
Product Line Performance
Sales Trends Over Time
💡 Key Insights:

Branch A in Yangon is a top performer in sales.
Health and Beauty products are among the most popular.
The E-wallet payment method is a favorite among customers, especially in Mandalay.
This project not only honed my technical skills but also provided a deep understanding of how data can drive business decisions. If you're interested in how data can unlock opportunities, let's connect and chat more about data-driven insights!
